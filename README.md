## P2718 Guide
A small guide is given for FP approximation evaluation.
### • Pre-steps
Before running the code, be sure you have downloaded from this link the following datasets:

1. *Data_3GHz_Hy_probe10_1cm.txt*
2. *Hy_R1.pt*

and they are in the same folder of *FP_approximation.ipynb*. 


### • FP approximation computation

1. Open *FP_approximation.ipynb*. You can do open and execute the notebook by Google Colab
2. Run the notebook

### • Hy_R1 computation
The *Hy_R1.pt* tensor is already computed from the raw data, in case you are interested to calculate it by yourself from raw data run the *CF4D_H.py*. Be sure the *Data_3GHz_Hy_probe10_1cm.txt* is in the same folder of *CF4D_H.py*.
